# 📚 Trivia Web App

A simple trivia app that started as a CS50 assignment and is evolving into a more interactive and user-friendly experience. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project explores clean UI, real-time feedback, and dynamic question navigation.

The goal was to build a small interactive quiz using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — applying DOM manipulation and dynamic styling concepts.
